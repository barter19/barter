## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of this template up and running on your local machine for development.

```
gem install sass
```

### Installing

```
npm install
```

### Development

```
npm start
```

### Generators
Automate your workflow and put less time and thought into adding container/presentational components, routes, and views by auto-generating them. You can also run `npm run generate <part>` to skip the first selection. (e.g. `npm run generate container`)

```
npm run generate
```

## Deployment

Run the following command to build your project.

```
npm run build
```

All production-ready files can be found in the `build` folder after running this command.
