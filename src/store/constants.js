 * Global Constants (Mutation Types)

 * Each action has a corresponding mutation type, which the mutator knows and
 * picks up on. To avoid weird typos between the mutations and the actions, we
 * save them as constants here.

 * Follow this format:
 * export const YOUR_ACTION_CONSTANT = 'YOUR_ACTION_CONSTANT';
